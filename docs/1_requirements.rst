Requirements
============

Django Crypto Extensions requires a supported Django version and runs on Python versions 3.6 and above.

Refer to the project source code repository in
`GitHub <https://github.com/DjangoCrypto/django-crypto-extensions>`_ and see the
`Tox configuration <https://github.com/DjangoCrypto/django-crypto-extensions/blob/main/tox.ini>`_ and
`Python package definition <https://github.com/DjangoCrypto/django-crypto-extensions/blob/main/setup.py>`_
to check if your Django and Python version are supported.
